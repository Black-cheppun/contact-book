# contact-book
this is a small python app made with tkinter and sqlite3 database,
it's an app that saves your contacts in a data base and you can view you saved contact, PS: its manual 

to try it out, you need python installed on your machine with and ide to open and view the code

Depending on your verion of python and os likewise you may or you may not need to install libraries since tkinter ans sqlite3 comes with python :)
But to install the libraries is not hard task, either search it on google or use pip install (name of lib). 

just make sure both files are in the same folder when you open them

one of them contains the front end of the app such as the buttons, text fields ... etc
the other contains the functions for the databse

ps: the database was made with classes so its an object oriented kind of code
